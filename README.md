# Virtual Agent Demo

## Project Objective
To create a basic virtual agent using Google CCAI's Dialogflow to demonstrate my ability to build AI-driven customer service solutions.

## Setup Steps
1. Set up GCP account and created a new project.
2. Enabled the Dialogflow API.
3. Created a Dialogflow agent named "Virtual Agent Demo".

## Intents Created
1. **Welcome Intent**
   - Training Phrases: “Hello”, “Hi”, “Hey”
   - Response: “Hello! How can I help you today?”
2. **Check Order Status**
   - Training Phrases: “Check my order status”, “Where is my order?”, “Track my order”
   - Response: “Please provide your order number.”
3. **Store Hours**
   - Training Phrases: “What are your store hours?”, “When are you open?”, “Store opening times”
   - Response: “Our store is open from 9 AM to 9 PM, Monday to Saturday.”

## Testing
- Successfully tested intents using Dialogflow Console’s chat interface.
